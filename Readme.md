# Teledraw Canvas

Teledraw Canvas is an HTML5 Canvas drawing engine that is used in [Teledraw.com](http://teledraw.com/). It is currently dependent on [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) (1.x.x).

You can see a very basic live demo at [lakenen.com/teledraw-canvas](http://lakenen.com/teledraw-canvas).

## How to use

Include teledraw-canvas.js in your page, and from there it's as simple as creating a canvas element with whatever width and height you want:

```html
<canvas id="test-canvas" width="512" height="512"></canvas>
```

and initializing the TeledrawCanvas:

```js
var canvas = new TeledrawCanvas('test-canvas');

// with options
var canvas = new TeledrawCanvas('test-canvas', {
	width: 512,
	height: 512,
	fullWidth: 1024,
	fullHeight: 1024,
	
	maxHistory: 20,
	minStrokeSize: 500,
	maxStrokeSize: 10000,
	minStrokeSoftness: 0,
	maxStrokeSoftness: 100,
	
	enableZoom: true, // true by default
	maxZoom: 8 // 800%
});
```

## API

### Setting tool color

Teledraw Canvas will accept any color string that works with CSS, as well as an array of RGB(A) values 0 to 255 (A: 0-1), (e.g. [255, 0, 0, 1.0] would be a fully opaque red).

```js
// by hex value
canvas.setColor('#ec823f');
// or
canvas.setColor('#fc0');

// by rgb
canvas.setColor('rgb(255, 0, 0)');

// by hsla
canvas.setColor('hsla(240, 100%, 50%, 0.5)');

// by common color name
canvas.setColor('lightGoldenrodYellow');

// by RGBA array
canvas.setColor([255, 0, 0, 0.5]);

// and so on...
```

### Picking a tool

Currently, the tools available are 'pencil', 'eraser', 'fill', 'rectangle', 'line', 'ellipse', 'eyedropper' and (if zoom is enabled) 'grab'. You can select them with `setTool`.

```js
// pencil
canvas.setTool('pencil');

// eraser
canvas.setTool('eraser');

// etc
```

### Adjusting the stroke style

You can modify how the stroke looks, including opacity, size and softness.

```js
// relatively small stroke
canvas.setStrokeSize(1000);
// relatively large stroke
canvas.setStrokeSize(10000);

// no softness
canvas.setStrokeSoftness(0);
// super blurry
canvas.setStrokeSoftness(100);

// fully opaque
canvas.setAlpha(1);
// fully transparent
canvas.setAlpha(0);
```

### Clear the canvas, undo, redo, zoom, pan, etc

Here are some basic useful functions...

```js
// clear the canvas
canvas.clear();

// undo
canvas.undo();
// redo
canvas.redo();

// reset tool defaults
canvas.defaults();

// zoom 200% to the center of the display
canvas.zoom(2);

// zoom 200% centered at (100,100)
canvas.zoom(2, 100, 100);

// pan up and to the left 100px
canvas.pan(-100, -100);
```


### Lower-level stuff

Changing the cursor, getting image data, reference to the canvas element, etc...

```js
// change the css cursor attribute on the canvas element
canvas.cursor('default');

// get a reference to the HTML Canvas element
var elt = canvas.canvas();

// get a 2d canvas rendering context for the canvas element
var ctx = canvas.ctx();

// returns a new (blank) canvas element the same size as this tdcanvas element
var tmpCanvas = canvas.getTempCanvas();

// returns a data url (image/png) of the canvas, optionally a portion of the canvas specified by x, y, w, h
var dataURL = canvas.toDataURL(0, 0, 100, 100);

// draw an image to the canvas and when it's finished, calls the given
// callback function (with `this` as the TeledrawCanvas Object)
// this is also an alias for canvas.fromImageURL
canvas.fromDataURL(url, function () { alert('done!'); });

// get the ImageData of the canvas element
var data = canvas.getImageData();

// sets the ImageData of the canvas element
canvas.putImageData(data);
```
